To Run: 

1) download the files into their own directory.

2) you must have python installed python.org

you  must have pip installed 

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

You can modify the 'products.csv' with excel etc if you like and add whatever images you want in that same directory; just put the filename as a line in that sheet. 

open your computers 'terminal' and type: 

pip install phidata pandas

export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<get your own key from aistudio.google.com>
python multimodal_ai_agentfrom_list.py 

You can change the spreadsheet products.csv to be whatever images you've uploaded into your folder here... I envision this being useful for a company doing competeitive research on it's own products etc. 

  For now I comments out the ability for it to read a video file first because I don't quite see a use case for that for most companies yet) 
  you could also make the output export to a word document by adding this code:

  from docx import Document
from datetime import datetime

# ... existing code ...

# Create a Word document
doc = Document()
doc.add_heading('Product Analysis Report', 0)
doc.add_paragraph(f'Generated on: {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}')

# 4. Loop through each product in the CSV
for index, row in products_df.iterrows():
    print(f"\n\n=== Analyzing Product {index + 1} ===\n")
    
    # Add product header to Word doc
    doc.add_heading(f'Product {index + 1}', level=1)
    
    image_url = row['link']
    response = agent.run(query, images=[image_url])  # Capture the response
    
    # Print to terminal
    print(response)
    
    # Add to Word document
    doc.add_paragraph(response)
    doc.add_paragraph('\n' + '-'*50 + '\n')  # Add separator

# Save the document
filename = f'product_analysis_{datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")}.docx'
doc.save(filename)
print(f"\nAnalysis exported to {filename}")

see the screenshot for how the output will look without that
