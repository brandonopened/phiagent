To Run: 

1) download the files into their own directory.

2) you must have python installed python.org

you  must have pip installed 

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

You can modify the 'products.csv' with excel etc if you like and add whatever images you want in that same directory; just put the filename as a line in that sheet. 

open your computers 'terminal' and type: 

pip install phidata pandas

export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<get your own key from aistudio.google.com>
python multimodal_ai_agentfrom_list.py 

You can change the spreadsheet products.csv to be whatever images you've uploaded into your folder here... I envision this being useful for a company doing competeitive research on it's own products etc. 

OLLAMA

Ollmaa is an open source AI running program that can use various models. Here I'm using the llama3.2-vision:11b model that can read video and images. I have an example output in the directory too - it's perhaps slower because my computer is slower, but 100% free and open source which is always worth supporting. 

Run 'python example_geminiagent.py' to see results! (example results in this directory too)
